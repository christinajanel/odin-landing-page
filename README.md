This is the second project from The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. This was coded from scratch to build out a landing page design mockup provided by TOP.

This was a lot of trial and error. The most difficult part was the Call to Action section. Aligning the "Sign Up" button and getting it shaped correctly was an issue. I'm still not super happy with its result. But I think my solution is a pretty good representation of the original design. I did not customize anything outside of adding links to Placedog.net for the placeholder images.

It was definitely a challenge in parts but overall a great learning experience. I know it could have been a lot more streamlined but I also know that that just comes with practice and experience.
